/**
 * Session wrap-up: the lifecycle exit for a session's local harness entries.
 *
 * When a session ends, its local entries default to orphans: a later session
 * (not on the parentSession chain) never sees them, and nothing promotes or
 * archives them — the exploration results effectively "die" with the session.
 * Wrap-up gives those entries a real exit:
 *
 * - cross-session-reusable content is classified `promote` and moved into the
 *   global store (through the human approval gate — global is a governed
 *   resource, exactly like skill proposals);
 * - session-specific / superseded / already-covered content is classified
 *   `archive` (hidden from injection, data stays restorable, rollbackable);
 * - everything else is kept.
 *
 * Division of labor is deliberate: the mechanical audit proposes, the LLM
 * classifies, the user approves, the code applies deterministically. The
 * apply-side guard (`filterPromotable`) re-checks global coverage at apply
 * time so a stale classification can never write a duplicate global entry.

export const WRAPUP_ASSESS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are the /evolve session wrap-up assessor.

A session is ending and its local harness entries need a fate. Classify each
listed entry exactly once:

- "promote" — the content is a stable, durable, CROSS-SESSION reusable lesson:
  a durable user preference, a project-level fact or convention, a reusable
  procedure or skill. Future sessions would benefit from seeing it.
- "archive" — the content is session-specific task progress, one-off noise,
  superseded or obsolete, or already covered by the global store (note
  "covered globally" in the reason), or stale (old + never injected — note
  "stale (injectionCount=0, recency low)" in the reason).
- "keep" — still actively useful to this session, or genuinely uncertain.

Rules:
- When an entry is marked "covered globally" in the listing, prefer "archive"
  or "keep" over "promote" — promoting a duplicate gains nothing.
- When an entry is marked "stale" (injectionCount=0 and low recency), prefer
  "archive" — the entry has never been used and is old, so it is unlikely to
  be needed again. Only "keep" if the content is clearly valuable despite low
  usage (e.g. a safety policy that rarely triggers but is critical).
- Do not promote local task state, work-in-progress notes, or content tied to
  one session's ephemeral details.
- Skills: only "promote" a skill entry that is a genuinely reusable procedure
  meeting the DSH skill quality standard; one-off workflows are "archive" or
  "keep".
- SPLIT PROMOTION: when an entry mixes a stable, cross-session-reusable part
  WITH session-specific snapshot details, do NOT promote it whole. Instead
  give verdict "archive" WITH a "promote" sub-object holding a CLEANED
  version of only the durable part (a stable title + the persistent facts,
  stripped of dates/states/one-off figures). Ephemeral snapshot content stays
  out of the sub-object — it is left behind in the archive. A sub-object is
  only meaningful on "archive" verdicts.

Return JSON only:
{
  "rationale": "one or two sentences",
  "items": [
    {"key": "memory:foo", "verdict": "promote|archive|keep", "reason": "why"},
