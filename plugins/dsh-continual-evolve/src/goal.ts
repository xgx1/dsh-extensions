/**
 * Goal-driven evolution rounds (v3 optional item, design.md §6): a
 * same-session goal turns the auto-review into a per-round driver — while a
 * goal is active, the review gate runs every round instead of every
 * `reviewIntervalTurns`, so the "continual evolution loop" is driven by the
 * goal's round machine (goal-round-driver keeps the session continuing) and
 * stops when the goal is completed or blocked.
 *
 * The goal service (`ctx.goals`) is resolved lazily and never required
 * (FAQ #1 discipline): without it, `/evolve goal` reports the feature
 * unavailable and auto-review keeps its plain interval.
